*Banking System Might need to be split further.
*comment by Diego: we might need to add a Message class to impement Serialized

** we could use ATM as parent and have Employee to inherit funtions like:
+debit card verification and reading
+deposit/withdrawls
+connecting to server

//Notes form Diego:
  We could make neater if we just pass Strings and int in Message rather than Class objects.
 Thus, reducing the amount of the constructors needed for Messages.
 So Server Class would just make the Class(Member,Employee,ATM, Account) objects for storage and call it there too.
 ex.
 public void BankingSystem::deposit(){
    message = (Message)objIn.readObject();
    obj.search(message.getWho)<----  this is String class not Member{
    ...
    ..
    .
      if(found){
      }
      else{
      message.setStatus(Fail);
      objOut.WriteObject(Message);
      ...
      ..
      .
      }
    }
 }
////Disclaimer: This notes above is an idea. I might help or not.
