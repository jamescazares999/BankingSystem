*Banking System Might need to be split further.
*comment by Diego: we might need to add a Message class to impement Serialized

//Notes From Amanual
Verifying Debit Card Information needs to be worked on; I think ATM should contain all debit card info, verify its accurate, then establish a connection with the bank server for banking requests

Or Bank server holds all Debit Cards and ATM just sends all info( number, pin) to server to verify. Also send what it wants over.

Need an efficient way to save all this data also; Each Customer/Employee/DebitCard gets a file of their own for their data or something.

** we could use ATM as parent and have Employee to inherit funtions like:
+debit card verification and reading
+deposit/withdrawls
+connecting to server

//Notes form Diego:
  We could make neater if we just pass Strings and int in Message rather than Class objects.
 Thus, reducing the amount of the constructors needed for Messages.
 So Server Class would just make the Class(Member,Employee,ATM, Account) objects for storage and call it there too.
 ex.
 public void BankingSystem::deposit(){
    message = (Message)objIn.readObject();
    obj.search(message.Member)<----  this is String class not Member // my bad I put getwho() which is correct
   
    {
    ...
    ..
    .
      if(found){
      }
      else{
      message.setStatus(Fail);
      objOut.WriteObject(Message);
      ...
      ..
      .
      }
    }
 }
